I began my first week at Grubhub last week. The new title is "technical specialist". 

Though it's not exactly where I want to be, I feel it is a good stepping-stone to a developer role in my future.

Getting experience at a software company is great as long as I can keep my coding skills sharp while I fulfill my duties in my current role.

I have a feeling that I will stay here for a year or two, and perhaps will be able to pivot into an engineering role at Grubhub if the opportunity arises.

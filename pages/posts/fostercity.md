The Commander's Palace is a piece of Foster City history. I'm pretty sure I read that a member of the original Foster family lived there. Here is a piece from the Chronicle about it:

> This four-bedroom, three-bathroom house located in the oldest neighborhood of Foster City was a unique sell because of its layout and location, said Compass real estate agent Julie Flouty, who listed the property. Waterfront homes in Foster City are desirable, but the views offered by this custom-build made it even more so. The city, just south of San Francisco International Airport in San Mateo County, is a planned community built in the 1960s by raising and expanding Brewer's Island, which was created by levees on the salt marshes of San Francisco Bay. The house is at the end of one of the city's seven cul-de-sac islands along a 6-foot-deep and 212-acre-wide lagoon, which acts as a drainage basin to withstand flooding from storms, said Flouty. This house saw an enormous amount of interest, with one major draw being the beachfront-style deck that leads down to the water, and ample space to watch boats and paddle-boarders ply the waterways, and to view activities at nearby Erckenbrack Park. "Waterfronts are emotional," said Flouty, who said the home's positioning at the end of the isle created an aura of relaxation and quiet. "It's hard to put a price on anything with a view; it's very subjective to that one individual." Waterfront locations are desirable, but in some communities, they also present some risk. Foster City was one of the Bay Area regions profiled by the Chronicle last year for its efforts to address sea level rise in years ahead. A $90 million project is currently underway there to build a stronger and taller levee that would keep the sea at bay. It is being financed by residents who were warned that without a new levee they would be forced to buy expensive flood insurance. As with many other regions of the Bay Area, the real estate market in Foster City saw a huge boom in 2020 and 2021, with most homes receiving multiple offers and many properties selling for as much as half a million dollars over asking price, Flouty said. While high mortgage rates and the summer season have slowed things, Flouty said Foster City remains very popular with buyers, particularly families who work in tech around Silicon Valley.
